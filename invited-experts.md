# Invite expert invitations

# Expectations

We generally welcome anyone interested in working on and improving privacy on the Web. However, we expect Privacy Working Group members to contribute, which can take the form of participating in privacy reviews, scribing calls, participating in discussions, among other things. Inactive or non-contributing invited experts may not be renewed.
